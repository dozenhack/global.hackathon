Before introducing about our team, we definitely like to say thanks both of the organizers oDesk and all the board member’s of Koding who allowing us to participate in their fantastic global hackathon program this year that call “Global Hackathon”

We want to Express – “It Sounds Like Hackers Meet the Cloud Cross the Border”

This is our page and the code name for our team is {DOZENH@CK}. It is good to know that DozenHack has been counting as a participant for “Global Hackathon” this year 2014. Dozenhack consisted with two members. One of them is Mahfuz who got sponsorship/referrals from oDesk as a Top Contractor/Performer in oDesk   to participate in Global Hackathon and another name is Farhadur Rahim – who having many years of experience in software engineering and software architect. In this competition, he will play a role for back-end support and make it easy for me by solving critical logics.
