<[DOZENH@CK]/>

Before introducing about our team, we definitely like to say thanks both of the organizers oDesk and all the board member’s of Koding who allowing us to participate in their fantastic global hackathon program this year that call “Global Hackathon”

This is our page and the code name for our team is {DOZENH@CK}. It is good to know that DozenHack has been counting as a participant for “Global Hackathon” this year 2014. Dozenhack consisted with the involves of two members. One of them is Mahfuz who got sponsorship/referrals from oDesk as a Top Contractor/Performer in oDeskto participate in Global Hackathon this year in terms of top performer.
